Text: I'm a perfectionist. Not a very good one, but one nonetheless. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">For example,</span> Let me demonstrate &#8211; this sentence that I am writing now will be deleted and re-typed no <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">more</span> less than <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">3</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">4</span> 5 times, and by the time I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">am finally done with it</span> type the final word I will most likely <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">still want to change something</span> find it imperfect. I hope that wasn&#8217;t too revealing, but now we can move on.

All that to say&#8230; I am finally launching a re-designed website to replace the landing page that has been sitting here for a while.

While this is the first real design to see the light of day, I am sure it will not be my last. Because it's not perfect.

### Perfect vs Good

In an interview for an internship position I was applying for, the interviewer asked me if I knew the line between a good decision and a perfect decision. I can't remember exactly what I said in that moment and it must not have stood out because I never heard back from them. But the question stuck with me.

In many of my pursuits my desire for perfection ends up killing the good. This realization has led me to start moving from the mentality that if it's not perfect then it will be nothing at all, to being able to discern when something is good enough and recognizing the need to move on.
