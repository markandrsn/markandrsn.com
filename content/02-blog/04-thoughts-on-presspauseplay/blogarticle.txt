I watched PressPausePlay this week. It’s a documentary about the digital revolution, and is up in its entirety on (link: http://vimeo.com/34608191 text: Vimeo). That’s pretty revolutionary in itself. If you like it, you should support it in some way, (link: http://www.presspauseplay.com/).

There were some great thoughts on digital culture, from marketing and business guru, (link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin text: Seth Godin), to the soft-spoken Icelandic, (link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93lafur_Arnalds text: Olafur Arnalds).

> We’re broadening the definition of what art is.
- Seth Godin

I tended to align myself more with the sentiment that the rise and accessibility of technology is, more or less, a good thing. It removes the financial and technological barriers that have limited artist’s in the past. However, this also means there will be significantly more noise to sift through.

Sure, it may make it more difficult for those who rely on creating to make a living. Or may disrupt the status quo and cause industry executives to rethink everything. But, is that really a bad thing?

(link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Keen text: Andrew Keen) thinks so, anyway. Keen believes that this digital revolution is destroying culture. I can understand the premise of this argument, but the idea that only professionals or experts should be guiding culture is absurd.

At the end of the day, stop making excuses for not creating. Stop waiting for permission. You don’t need a record/book/movie deal, or loads of money. You can create where you are, with what you have, right now. That is a beautiful thing.

Exciting times.
