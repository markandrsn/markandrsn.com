Text: I have a hard time keeping the places I’ve been and the things I’ve seen straight. Sometimes I hurt myself trying to remember those details. I don’t like it when that happens. Luckily, the iPhone has a feature built into the camera to help me. It’s called Places.

Not many people are aware of this, but every picture you take on your iPhone is (link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging text: geotagged using GPS to the location it was taken. This then allows you to browse your photos by the places they were taken. Genius!

If you regularly take pictures with your iPhone, then go to the built-in Photos app and click the Places tab on the bottom right. A map will come up with pins marking locations pictures have been taken. Then you can select a location and see all the pictures taken at that location! It’s an amazing way of connecting pictures to places. We live in the future!
